        Back in 2022, when I was still in high school, I participated in

        in the Solo Guitar category. This is one of my favorite hobbies—playing
        the guitar to unwind. I passed the district-level selection and advanced
        to the provincial level in East Nusa Tenggara.

        <br /><br />
        The preparation was quite intense. I practiced every day, chose a song
        that showcased both technique and emotion, and performed in front of the
        judges in August 2022. I felt proud to represent my school.
        Unfortunately, I didn't make it to the nationals because the competition
        was incredibly tough. Only the provincial 1st-place winner advanced, and
        I had to admit my skills weren't quite enough to go further.

        <br /><br />
        Though I didn’t reach the nationals, this experience enriched my musical
        journey.
