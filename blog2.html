      I played a guitar solo at a campus event recently.<br />
      The crowd loved my rendition of a classic rock song! Check out the song I
      played here:<br />
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
        >Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses</a
      >.<br />
      It was my first time performing in front of so many people, and the cheers
      made it unforgettable.<br />
      Practicing those riffs for weeks was totally worth it!
