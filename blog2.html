        In 2024, I took on an academic challenge at

        <a
          href="https://pusatprestasinasional.kemdikbud.go.id/event/riset-dan-inovasi/dikti/olimpiade-nasional-matematika-dan-ilmu-pengetahuan-alam-perguruan-tinggi-2024-2023-dikti"
          >Olimpiade Nasional MIPA Perguruan Tinggi (ONMIPA) 2024</a
        >. I chose Mathematics because it has been one of my strengths since
        high school. The journey began with an internal selection at Sam
        Ratulangi University. I achieved

        <b>2nd place at the university level </b> and advanced to the provincial
        level in North Sulawesi.

        <br /><br />
        At the provincial level, I trained hard, studying past questions and
        problem banks from BPTI. The regional selection was held online on April
        24-25, 2024. I was thrilled to reach this stage, though there was a
        slight disappointment as I didn’t qualify for the nationals, which took
        place at Hasanuddin University in May 2024. Only the 1st-place winners
        from each region and a few top ranks advanced, and I fell just short of
        the quota.

        <br /><br />
        Even so, this experience taught me about strategy and precision. I plan
        to try again next year!
