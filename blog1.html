      The year 2024 became one of the most memorable moments in my journey as an
      Information Technology student at Sam Ratulangi University. I had the
      opportunity to participate in

        >Peksiminas 2024</a
      >, a national-level student art competition held at the State University
      of Jakarta from September 2-6, 2024. The journey was far from easy—months
      of practice, balancing academics, and honing my skills in visual arts
      (Comic Strip).

      <br /><br />
      Starting from the university-level selection to the regional level, I
      finally qualified for the nationals, representing North Sulawesi. There, I
      competed against hundreds of talented students from across Indonesia. The
      process was full of pressure, but it taught me a lot about resilience and
      creativity. The result? I secured

      <b>8th place nationally! </b>Though it wasn't the top podium, this
      achievement proved that my hard work paid off.
